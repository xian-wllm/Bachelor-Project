# Bachelor Project

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/xian-wllm/Bachelor-Project)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and data associated with a Bachelor project exploring **quantum non-locality** using the **inflation technique**. The main objective is to analyze the feasibility limits of quantum correlations in order to determine whether they can be described by **local hidden variable (LHV) models**.

The inflation technique is employed as a systematic method to derive necessary constraints for such models and to certify non-local behavior.

The project implements feasibility tests for several probability distributions, in particular those derived from **GHZ** and **W** quantum states, using **polygonal inflation scenarios**.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.x  
- [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/install/index.html) — Library for modeling convex optimization problems  
- [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/downloads/) — High-performance optimization solver (free academic license available)  
- `numpy`  
- `matplotlib`  

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install cvxpy numpy matplotlib
```

## Repository Structure

- **`chsh_inequality/`**  
  Contains scripts for exploring the Bell–CHSH inequality under different assumptions (local realism and no-signaling). These scripts provide the conceptual groundwork for the study of quantum non-locality.

- **`main/`**  
  Contains the core implementation of the inflation technique.

  - **`general_code/`**  
    Scripts to compute feasibility boundaries for correlators (E1, E2) using both simple inflation and nested (“contained”) inflation methods.

  - **`visibility/`**  
    Scripts dedicated to computing the critical visibility `v` for which quantum distributions remain compatible with the inflation model.

- **`data/`**  
  Stores numerical data generated by simulations run from the `main` directory. These datasets represent the computed feasibility boundaries.

- **`plot/`**  
  Contains Python scripts using `matplotlib` to visualize the data stored in `data/` and to generate the plots presented in the project analysis.

## Execution

To run the numerical computations, execute the main scripts. For example, to compute feasibility limits for simple inflations with an increasing number of vertices:

```bash
python main/general_code/corrolator_inflation.py

**Warning:** These computations can be extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for large numbers of vertices.

## Visualization

To generate plots from the precomputed data stored in the `data/` directory, run the scripts in the `plot/` directory. For example:

```bash
python plot/best_of_each_inflation.py

The paper investigates whether symmetries observed in probability distributions necessarily imply the existence of symmetric causal explanations. Using causal compatibility techniques closely related to the **inflation hierarchy**, it demonstrates that certain symmetric correlations admit no symmetric classical or quantum causal model.

The numerical feasibility tests, optimization-based methods, and inflation-inspired techniques implemented in this repository directly support and inform the results presented in this work.
